		<title>Scramble says, “Six More Weeks of Winter”</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today, February 2, 2018, Scramble made a historic prediction. Attended with many people, this Duck Day was one of the biggest ever. As the opening speech was read, it mentioned the history of weather predicting. It mentioned that there was a better way. It mentioned that that way was Scramble the Duck! Scramble walked out of the miniature Ivy Glenn Memorial and strolled down the red carpet. After looking for a shadow, Scramble the Duck predicted six more weeks of winter. Scramble has made four predictions including this one, and has always been accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;lite-youtube videoid=&quot;rE18heMbZ8I&quot; style=&quot;background-image: url(&#39;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rE18heMbZ8I/hqdefault.jpg&#39;);&quot; class=&quot;undefined&quot; title=&quot;Duck Day 2018&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/lite-youtube&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, Scramble was awarded an official State of Connecticut Citation by State Representative Pat Boyd for his accurate predictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The citation stated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;citation&quot;&gt;General Assembly Official Citation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduced by &lt;/strong&gt;Representative Patrick S. Boyd, 50th District; Senator Anthony Guglielmo, 35th District&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be it hereby known to all that: The Connecticut General Assembly hereby offers its sincerest congratulations to: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scramble The Duck&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In recognition of&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being The Most Accurate Weather-Predicting Duck In The Northern Hemisphere And Possibly The World. Eastford&#39;s Own Scramble The Duck Has A Knack For Weather-Predicting; Historically Making Correct Predictions All Three Times. We&#39;re Quackers About Scramble!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The entire membership extends its very best wishes on this memorable occasion and expresses the hope for continued success. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Special thanks to State Representative Pat Boyd and Senator Tony Gugliemo for introducing this citation.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Scramble has been accurate yet again. Today is the end of the six weeks, and there is still much snow on the ground. You may have heard &lt;abbr title=&quot;National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&quot;&gt;NOAA’s&lt;/abbr&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.noaa.gov/news/sorry-groundhog-february-and-winter-2018-were-warmer-than-average-for-us&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; that it was an early spring. However, they made that report before the end of the six weeks (on March 7). It is impossible to judge before the end of the six weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Scramble says six weeks, it means &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; six more weeks of winter.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Scramble the Duck will be in the Eastford Memorial Day Parade on May 28. The Parade will start at 9:30 a.m. at the Eastford Elementary School (12 Westford Rd.), and end at the Ivy Glenn Memorial (179 Rt. 198) where Scramble makes his predictions. Following the parade will be a ceremony. Scramble will be alongside veterans, the East Woodstock Cornet Band, Fire Trucks, Antique cars and more. In case of rain, the parade will be canceled and the ceremony will be held in the School’s gym. If you haven’t met Scramble yet, this is a great opportunity to meet him in person.&lt;/p&gt;

		<updated>2019-01-01T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
		<id>https://scrambletheduck.org/news/2019/01/01/scrambles-website-upgraded/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When we first set up Scramble’s website, we used &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;wordpress.com&lt;/a&gt; for its simplicity and affordability, at the address &lt;a href=&quot;http://scrambletheduck.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;scrambletheduck.wordpress.com&lt;/a&gt;. However, through the past year, the shortcomings of &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;wordpress.com&lt;/a&gt; (notably the increasing advertisements and price for a custom domain) for a specialized website such as Scramble’s have made a new, more customizable website (&lt;a href=&quot;http://scrambletheduck.org/&quot;&gt;scrambletheduck.org&lt;/a&gt;) desirable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will leave the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scrambletheduck.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;scrambletheduck.wordpress.com&lt;/a&gt; site up, but its content will not be updated. From now on, all updates and new information will be posted exclusively to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scrambletheduck.org/&quot;&gt;scrambletheduck.org&lt;/a&gt;, and all pertinent content from the old site has been transferred to the new site.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This morning, Scramble the Duck predicted six more weeks of winter. Although it was very cold, loyal fans made the trek out to Eastford to see Scramble give his prognostication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the &lt;a href=&quot;https://scrambletheduck.org/speeches/2019/opening/&quot;&gt;opening speech&lt;/a&gt; was read, it mentioned the history of weather predicting and mentioned that the better way was Scramble the Duck. The doors of the model Ivy Glenn were opened, and Scramble waddled down the red carpet. Immediately after, Scramble looked for his shadow, and found it. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://scrambletheduck.org/speeches/2019/announcement/&quot;&gt;prediction announcement&lt;/a&gt; was read, forecasting six more weeks of winter. Scramble has made five predictions, including this one, and as always been &lt;a href=&quot;https://scrambletheduck.org/accuracy/&quot;&gt;accurate.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;lite-youtube videoid=&quot;WyRGoDVBEfA&quot; style=&quot;background-image: url(&#39;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WyRGoDVBEfA/hqdefault.jpg&#39;);&quot; class=&quot;undefined&quot; title=&quot;Duck Day Prediction 2019&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/lite-youtube&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Whatever be your desire,&lt;br&gt;
Be snow or cold or rain&lt;br&gt;
I saw my shadow today&lt;br&gt;
The answer is very plain.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Six More Weeks of Winter!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;a href=&quot;https://scrambletheduck.org/&quot;&gt;Scramble the Duck&lt;/a&gt;, February 2, 2019&lt;/cite&gt;

		<id>https://scrambletheduck.org/news/2019/03/22/scramble-proved-correct-again/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Scramble has been accurate yet again. The six weeks have ended, astronomical spring has started, but there is still snow on the ground. You may have heard various statements about warmth, but the majority of affected people still agree with Scramble. The only way to determine whether it is still winter is to determine how people feel about it. After all, it may be “officially” spring now, but many feel the weather is still winter‐like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Scramble says six weeks, it means &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; six more weeks of winter.&lt;/p&gt;
