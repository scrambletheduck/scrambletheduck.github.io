		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Every year we host Duck Day, Eastford’s alternative to Groundhog Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putting on the event takes a great amount of preparation and time. As Duck Day has grown, the time we must invest has increased. Because we want to continue to serve the community and showcase Scramble’s prognostication success for the benefit of all, we are looking for more help for Duck Day in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are looking for volunteers who would enjoy working with Scramble and the public on Duck Day. We are currently accepting applications for various positions. These can be found at &lt;a href=&quot;https://scrambletheduck.org/volunteer&quot;&gt;scrambletheduck.org/volunteer&lt;/a&gt;. Applications can be sent to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:volunteers@scrambletheduck.org&quot;&gt;volunteers@scrambletheduck.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We look forward to working aside some of you in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Scramble the Duck’s Winter Prediction Proved Accurate</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;With the days of spring beginning, the snowstorms and cold weather throughout the past six weeks show that Scramble the Duck, Jr.’s prediction was accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scramble predicted six more weeks of wintery weather on February 2. The following blizzards and cold temperatures showed Scramble’s strong ability to forecast the weather provided an accurate prediction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Scramble the Duck, Jr. predicted the weather for the first time, the training from the credible Stormy Heights Academy as well as the mentoring of his predecessor showed the importance of rigorous education in weather prognostication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While other weather predictors in Connecticut and throughout the United States predicted an early spring, Scramble’s accurate judgement once again showed the credibility of Eastford’s weather predictor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scramble is pleased to present an accurate prediction to the people of Connecticut and elsewhere and looks forward to future service to his community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eastford’s weather predictor has made eight predictions and has always been &lt;a href=&quot;https://scrambletheduck.org/accuracy/&quot;&gt;accurate.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today, at 7:30 a.m., Scramble the Duck predicted six more weeks of winter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://scrambletheduck.org/speeches/2022/opening/&quot;&gt;opening speech&lt;/a&gt; was read, describing the history of weather predicting, concluding with a statement Scramble the Duck’s guaranteed accuracy. After, the doors of the model Ivy Glenn were opened, and Scramble walked out to a red carpet and excited crowd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immediately after, Scramble looked for his shadow, and then told his handlers which scroll to read. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://scrambletheduck.org/speeches/2022/announcement/&quot;&gt;prediction announcement&lt;/a&gt; told that Scramble had seen a shadow, forecasting another six weeks of winter. While Scramble the Duck, Jr. was new to weather predicting this year, Eastford’s prognosticator &lt;a href=&quot;https://scrambletheduck.org/accuracy/&quot;&gt;has a perfect record of accuracy.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Announcing the Passing of Scramble the Duck</title>

		<id>https://scrambletheduck.org/news/2021/12/01/announcing-the-passing-of-scramble-the-duck/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It is with sadness that we announce the passing of Scramble after 7 wonderful years. (7 years old is old for a duck.) We are forever grateful for his help in predicting the weather in Eastford and the cheer he brought to many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scramble helped establish the paramount weather predicting standard that has no rivals, all of which has become Stormy Heights Academy&#39;s curriculum. Through his work weather forecasting has become much more accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the job of Eastford weather predictor is a strenuous job requiring great training, we are currently interviewing possible candidates for the job, which will be followed by a rigorous education and training. (Scramble gave us the instructions on how to go about this.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duck Day will continue, and further announcements will follow. Scramble appreciated everyone who has helped make Duck Day truly ducky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scramble served all of us well. We are grateful for everything he provided to us and to the town of Eastford.&lt;/p&gt;
