		<title>Scramble Proved Correct Again</title>
		<link href="https://scrambletheduck.org/news/2020/03/19/scramble-proved-correct-again/"/>
		<updated>2020-03-19T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
		<id>https://scrambletheduck.org/news/2020/03/19/scramble-proved-correct-again/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Scramble has been proved correct yet again. Scramble the duck predicted six more weeks of winter on February 2, 2020. At first it was warm, but people realized Scramble was right. As the truth became clear, some rushed to the store to stock up on essentials, preparing to stay at home as if for a long blizzard. Scramble, once again, has proven his 100% accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement to his team, Scramble said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would never have imagined that my prediction was so significant. This is not just a blizzard of frozen water, but rather a blizzard of disease and human fear. I foresaw that something of great importance was about to happen, something would cause people to hunker down; and I have been actively involved with finding solutions. My colleagues have been collaborating with authorities to help in this fight. Right now, we encourage everybody to take &lt;a href=&quot;https://coronavirus.gov/&quot;&gt;public health authorities&#39; advice&lt;/a&gt; seriously and help end this winter-like condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

		<title>Scramble forecasts Six More Weeks of Winter</title>
		<link href="https://scrambletheduck.org/news/2020/02/02/scramble-forecasts-six-more-weeks-of-winter/"/>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today, at 7:30 a.m., Scramble the Duck predicted six more weeks of winter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After an &lt;a href=&quot;https://scrambletheduck.org/speeches/2020/opening/&quot;&gt;opening speech&lt;/a&gt; was read, the doors of the model Ivy Glenn were opened, and Scramble waddled down the red carpet to the sound of a trumpet fanfare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://scrambletheduck.org/assets/images/img_6658.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Scramble tells his handlers his prediction&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; srcset=&quot;https://scrambletheduck.org/assets/images/img_6658-w200.jpeg 200w, https://scrambletheduck.org/assets/images/img_6658-w300.jpeg 300w, https://scrambletheduck.org/assets/images/img_6658-w600.jpeg 600w, https://scrambletheduck.org/assets/images/img_6658-w800.jpeg 800w, https://scrambletheduck.org/assets/images/img_6658-w1000.jpeg 1000w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 60rem) 100vw, 66vw&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immediately after, Scramble looked for his shadow, and then told his handlers which scroll to read. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://scrambletheduck.org/speeches/2020/announcement/&quot;&gt;prediction announcement&lt;/a&gt; was read, forecasting six more weeks of winter. Scramble has made six predictions, including this one, and as always been &lt;a href=&quot;https://scrambletheduck.org/accuracy/&quot;&gt;accurate.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
